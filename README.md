Welcome to my Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Gaps checklist site. 
This applies to the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and not the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 Remake. I made this as an easier way to track which gaps I needed in order to 100% the gaps in the game. 
In game the only way to view your gaps is to go to the Main Menu > Settings > Gap Checklist. This makes it a little bit easier and you can update your gaps as you earn them. 

To use the "site" as is, you can open any of the .html pages in your browser of choice. Index.html is the "Home" page of the site. 

I have a rudementary knowledge of html so how I "saved" my gaps from one session to the next was to add checked to the end of the input. You can see my example below 

<div class="gap">
  <label for="tcrg">TC's Roof Gap</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="tcrg" id="tcrg" value="TC's Roof Gap" checked> 
</div>

The site is completely open for you to use as you need. Make any changes you would like.
